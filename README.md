# Example `chalice_plus` project

This is an example project to demonstrate how the [`chalice_plus`](https://github.com/kingstonlabs/chalice-plus) framework can be used.

To set up run:

`pip install -r local_requirements.txt`


## Running locally
Update the environment variables in the "local" stage of `.chalice/config.json` to point to your database, then run:

`$ alembic upgrade head`

The local server can then be run with:

`$ chalice local --stage local`


## Deploying to AWS
Add the following SSM parameters:
* `chalice_plus_example.dev.DATABASE_USER`
* `chalice_plus_example.dev.DATABASE_PASSWORD`
* `chalice_plus_example.dev.DATABASE_HOST`
* `chalice_plus_example.dev.DATABASE_NAME`

Then deploy with:

`$ chalice_plus deploy`
